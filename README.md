# art_gallery_database
Project repository for CS340 databases class.
Delete.js files and update.js files adapted from https://github.com/osu-cs340-ecampus/nodejs-starter-app
We don't have dropdowns implemented but we use buttons that automatically supply the related items key to the back end instead and have
an error message pop up if a user tries to delete a foreign key, so this should act the same as a dropdown.
