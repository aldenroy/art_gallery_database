# art_gallery_database
Project repository for CS340 databases class.
Delete.js files and update.js files adapted from https://github.com/osu-cs340-ecampus/nodejs-starter-app
We have dropdowns implemented for the one that needs it but we use buttons that automatically supply the 
related items key to the back end instead and have an error message pop up if a user tries to delete a 
foreign key, so this should act the same as a dropdown.
Also, for some weird parsing error apostrophes aren't accepted so don't do that in testing
